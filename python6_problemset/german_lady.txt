German lady by Shel Silverstein

German lady loves me,
German lady cares,
German lady picks me peaches and pears.
German lady offers me candy and Cokes,
German lady listens and laughs at me jokes.
German lady helps when I get in a fight,
German lady does all my homework at night.
German lady misses me,
German lady cries,
German lady thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that German lady is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and German lady just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for German lady's hand,
In the darkness where German lady usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
German lady's gone!
